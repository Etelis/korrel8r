Korrel8r is a correlation engine for observable signals.

It can relate Kubernetes objects with many types of signal data.
The data can be stored in separate signal stores, and encoded using different schema.

Given a _start_ object, korrel8r searches for a chain of rules to related _goal_ objects.
Korrel8r can also show the _neighbourhood_ of all data related to an object of interest.

A REST API allows clients to make correlation queries.
It may be deployed as a service in a cluster, or run outside the cluster and connect to signal stores inside the cluster.
