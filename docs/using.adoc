= Using Korrel8r

Korrel8r connects to multiple data _stores_ such as loki for logs, prometheus for metrics, and the kube-API server for cluster resources.
It provides a REST API for running correlation _queries_ using a set of _rules_ that relate object within and between stores.
Korrel8r can be run as a plain executable, outside the cluster, and connect to the API server and stores inside the cluster.
It can also run as a deployed service inside the cluster.

== Running the Executable

#FIXME - move from README, use default config.

== Deploying the Service

#FIXME - move from README, use default config.

== Configuration

#FIXME doc in config pkg close to code. Stores and rules. Mention default config, show examples.

== REST API

#FIXME - link to reference. Curl examples of API, use swagger UI.
