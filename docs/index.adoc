[abstract]

Korrel8r is a correlation engine for observability signals and observable resources. +
It can correlate across multiple domains, diverse signal types, inconsistent labelling and varied data stores. +

== Overview

Korrel8r is a correlation engine for _observability signals_ and _observed resources_.
A _signal_ is a unit of observation data such as a log record, a trace record, a metric time-series, or an alert.
A _resource_ is something to be observed, such as a Kubernetes Pod or Deployment.

The goal of korrel8r is to express relationships between _objects_(resources or signals) in different _domains_ as _rules_,
and to automatically navigate the resulting graph of rules and objects to find related data.

For example: an alert is raised on a cluster console.
Diagnosing the problem, requires logs from the containers that caused the alert.
Korrel8rs can automatically follow the chain of relationships `alert -> deployment -> pod -> logs` and
display the related logs directly.

Given a _start_ object (e.g. an Alert in a cluster) and a _goal_ (e.g. _find related logs_)
the engine can search for a chain of rules leading from start to  goal data.
The engine can also display the _neighbourhood_ of all related data around some object of interest.

The rules capture expert knowledge about troubleshooting in an executable form.
The engine aims to provide common rule-base that can be re-used in many settings:
as a service, in consoles, in command line tools, or offline data-processing systems.

The goals of this project include:

* Encode domain knowledge from SREs and other experts as re-usable rules.
* Automate navigation from symptoms to data that helps diagnose causes.
* Relate diverse data that is held in different types of storage with different schema.
* Reduce multiple-step manual procedures to fewer clicks or queries.
* Help tools that gather and analyze diagnostic data to focus on relevant information.

=== Key Concepts

Object::
An instance of a signal or resource.

Domain::
A family of related objects (signals and/or resources) with common storage and representation. +
Examples: `k8s` (Kubernetes resources), `alert` (Prometheus alerts), `metric` (Prometheus metrics), `log` (Loki logs), `trace` (OpenTelemetry traces) +
#FIXME: xref domain ref section#

Store::
A source of stored objects from a single Domain.
Examples: Loki `log`, Prometheus `alert`, Kubernetes API server `k8s`.

Query::
A Query selects a set of objects from a store. The structure of a query depends on the domain of the store.

Class::
A subset of objects in a Domain with a common schema (the same field definitions).
Classes are named <class-name>.<domain-name> +
Examples: `Pod.k8s`, `DaemonSet.k8s` `audit.log`

Rule::
A Rule applies to an object of a _start_ class, and generates a query for a _goal_ class.
The start and goal can be in different domains (e.g. `Pod.k8s` â†’ `application.log`)
A rule definition is a _template_ that constructs a query for the _goal class_
using the native field names of an object of the _start class_.
Rules provide the bridge between domains with inconsistent labels and schema.

=== Conflicting Vocabularies

Different signal and object domains may use different vocabularies to
identify the same things. For example:

* `k8s.pod.name` (trace)
* `pod` or `pod_name` (metric)
* `kubernetes.pod_name` (log)

The correlation problem would be simpler if there was a single vocabulary to describe signal attributes.
The https://opentelemetry.io/[Open Telemetry Project] aims to create such a standard vocabulary,
but in the short to medium term we will have to contend with mixed-format signals.
Korrel8r expresses rules in the native vocabulary of each domain and allowing rules to cross domains.

=== Examples of Objects

A Kubernetes cluster generates many types of _observable signal_, including:

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Signal Type |Description
|Metrics |Counts and measurements of system behaviour.

|Alerts |Rules that fire when metrics cross important thresholds.

|Logs |Application, infrastructure and audit logs from Pods and cluster
nodes.

|Kubernetes Events |Describe significant events in a cluster.

|Traces |Nested execution spans describing distributed requests.

|Network Events |TCP and IP level network information.
|===

A cluster also contains _resources_ that are not usually considered ``signals'',
but that can be correlated with signals and other resources:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Resource Type |Description
|k8s resources |Spec and status information.
|Run books |Problem solving guides associated with Alerts.
|k8s probes |Information about resource state.
|===

Korrel8r does not distinguish between signals and resources, and refers to both as `objects`.
