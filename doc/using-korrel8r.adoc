. Refresh the web console
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Logs*. Click the *Metrics* link to see correlated metrics of each log record.
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Alerting*, and click an alert. Alerts that have related logs have a *see related logs* link.

[TIP]
====
Not all alerts have a *see related logs* link. Only alerts that are _related_ to container workloads can have related logs. For example, `KubePodCrashLooping` is related to a pod and so can have related logs. See the xref:troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting-no-related-logs[There is no "see related logs" link] documentation for more information.
