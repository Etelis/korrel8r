= Releasing a new version

Steps to release a new version, for maintainers.

On branch `main`:

. Update the VERSION variable in `Makefile` to the semantic version number of the release (no leading "v")
. `make all image` - must pass with no errors.
. Commit and push your changes with comment "Release X.Y.Z".
+
NOTE: Normally the only changes in a release commit are `Makefile` and `version.txt`
. `make release` - does the following:
  - Re-run `make all image`
  - Run `hack/tag-release.sh`: check the working tree is clean, create and push the git vX.Y.Z tag.
  - Push a `:latest` tag for the korrel8r image.
